An ACS for permutation flow-shop sequencing
=============

I am trying to reproduce the following paper.
Ying, Kuo-Ching, and Ching-Jong Liao. "An ant colony system for permutation flow-shop sequencing." Computers & Operations Research 31.5 (2004): 791-801.


You can find the results at the "report" folder.
